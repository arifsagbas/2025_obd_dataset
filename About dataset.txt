Driving Behavior Dataset

This repository contains a labeled time-series dataset for analyzing different driving behaviors based on acceleration, deceleration, and engine conditions. Each data sample is stored in CSV format and represents a short driving segment collected under a specific driving pattern.

File Structure:

Each file is named using the following format:

<Label>_<Date>.csv

<Label>: A numeric class label (1–6) indicating the type of driving behavior.

<Date>: The recording date in YYMMDD format (e.g., 20250215 corresponds to February 15, 2025).

Example:

1_20250215.csv → Very calm acceleration and deceleration

3_20250301.csv → Aggressive driving

Label Descriptions:

1 → Very calm acceleration and deceleration
2 → Normal driving with moderate acceleration and braking
3 → Aggressive driving with sharp acceleration and braking
4 → Constant speed driving at eco-friendly (ideal RPM) conditions
5 → Constant speed driving at non-eco (high RPM) conditions
6 → A combination of Label 1 and 4: calm and safe eco-driving on highways

Notes:

All data were collected using a smartphone-based sensing framework.

Each CSV file contains multivariate time-series data representing motion, engine, and road parameters during a short driving session.

The dataset can be used for research on driver behavior classification, eco-driving detection, and time-series modeling.
